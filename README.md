# ‚ú® Features & Highlights


JWT Authentication & Role-Based Access Control: Secure, stateless authentication with flexible permission handling.

Wallet Balance Management: Maintain accurate, real-time balances with optimistic locking to prevent race conditions.

Peer-to-Peer Transfers: Fast, atomic transactions between users within the platform.

Bank Transfers via Paystack Integration: Effortlessly send funds externally with full webhook support for asynchronous transaction status updates.

Comprehensive Transaction History: Detailed audit trails for every wallet operation.

Transactional Integrity: All critical operations are atomic and consistent, ensuring financial data safety.

Webhook-Driven Real-Time Updates: Stay synchronized with Paystack events for up-to-the-second status accuracy.

Rate Limiting: Protect the system and users by limiting request frequency on sensitive endpoints.

# Architecture Decisions üèóÔ∏è

Nano_Purse employs a clean, layered architecture designed for scalability, maintainability, and clear separation of concerns. 
This modular approach allows each layer to focus on specific responsibilities, improving testability and enabling easier future enhancements.

Layer Breakdown:
Controller Layer:
Handles HTTP requests and responses, enforces security policies, and performs input validation at the API boundary.
It acts as the interface between external clients and the backend system.

Service Layer:
Contains core business logic, including wallet management, transaction processing, fee calculation, and integration with external services like Paystack. 
This layer orchestrates workflows and ensures transactional integrity.

Repository Layer:
Provides data access via JPA/Hibernate to interact with the PostgreSQL database. 
It abstracts persistence operations and supports efficient querying and updates with optimistic locking.

Configuration Layer:
Centralizes application configuration, including security settings, rate limiting policies, API clients (e.g., Paystack), and other beans required throughout the application lifecycle. 
This layer ensures clean setup and dependency injection.

Utils Layer:
Provides reusable utility classes and helper functions, such as formatting currency amounts, date/time handling, cryptographic utilities, and other common operations used across multiple layers.

DTO (Data Transfer Object) Layer:
Defines request and response objects used for API communication. DTOs encapsulate data structures sent to and from clients,
ensuring clear API contracts and decoupling internal domain models from external representations.

Factory Layer:
Implements object creation patterns for complex domain objects or DTOs, managing initialization logic and promoting immutability or validation before creation.
This layer improves maintainability and consistency in object construction.

Model Layer:
Represents the core domain entities such as User, Wallet, Transaction, etc. These are the business objects persisted in the database and manipulated by the service layer.

Exception Layer:
Contains custom exceptions, error codes, and global exception handlers that provide consistent error responses and centralized error management across the API.


# Design Decisions:

ACID-Compliant PostgreSQL Database: Ensures transaction safety and data integrity essential for financial applications.

Optimistic Locking: Prevents concurrent balance update conflicts without heavy locking overhead.

Modular Service Design: Separates concerns clearly, enabling easier testing and feature expansion.

JWT-Based Security: Supports stateless sessions with role-based access control for fine-grained authorization.

DTO Usage: Enforces clear API contracts and reduces exposure of internal entities.

Efficient SQL Indexing: Optimizes query performance for high-throughput wallet operations.

# ASSUMPTIONS:


Single-Currency Support: The application is tailored for the Nigerian Naira (NGN), with all monetary values stored in base units 
(e.g., ‚Ç¶100 is represented as 10,000 kobo, in line with Paystack's standards).

Moderate Transaction Load: Optimized for standard usage scenarios rather than high-frequency trading. 
It employs optimistic locking to ensure safe concurrent updates.

Paystack Integration for External Transfers: Paystack serves as the primary payment gateway for handling external transactions. 
The system uses webhooks to receive and process transaction status updates reliably.

Transaction Fees: For every external transfer, an estimated transaction fee is automatically applied based on the transfer amount.
This ensures transparency and helps cover processing costs.

Strict One-to-One Wallet Mapping: Each user is associated with exactly one wallet, ensuring a simplified and consistent wallet management model.

Backend-Centric Validation: Security and input validation are handled primarily at the backend, under the assumption that requests from clients have already been pre-validated and sanitized.

Rate Limiting: To protect system stability and prevent abuse, rate limiting is enforced on critical endpoints, controlling the number of allowed requests per user within defined time windows 
in line with the moderate transaction load assumption.
